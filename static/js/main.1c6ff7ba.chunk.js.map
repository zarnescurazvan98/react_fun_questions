We inherited this ability from our ancestors in part as a way for our (then) coat of body hair to capture air beneath it and in that way retain heat. But, as George A. Bubenik, a physiologist and professor of zoology at the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada, explained to Scientific American, it also caused our ancestors to appear bigger than they were, helping to ward off predators when they were frightened or on the defense. With modern humans having less body hair, goosebumps no longer cause us to look that much more intimidating.',\n\t},\n\t{\n\t\tid: 2,\n\t\ttitle: \"What's the hottest spot on Earth?\",\n\t\tinfo: 'The hottest spot on the planet is in Libya. Specifically, the hottest spot ever recorded on Earth is El Azizia, in Libya, where a temperature of 136 degrees Fahrenheit was recorded on Sept. 13, 1922. While hotter spots have likely occurred in other parts of the planet at other times, this is the most scorching temperature ever formally recorded by a weather station.',\n\t},\n\t{\n\t\tid: 3,\n\t\ttitle: 'Why does airplane food taste bad?',\n\t\tinfo: \"You lose up to 30 percent of your taste buds during flight and the elevation in an airplane can have a detrimental effect on our ability to taste things. According to a 2010 study conducted by Germany's Fraunhofer Institute for Building Physics, the dryness experienced at a high elevation as well as low pressure reduces the sensitivity of a person's taste buds to sweet and salty foods by about 30 percent. Add that dry cabin air affects our ability to smell, and our ability to taste is reduced further.\",\n\t},\n\t{\n\t\tid: 4,\n\t\ttitle: 'Did you know?',\n\t\tinfo: 'The English word with the most definitions is \"set\".
